            "Wow, you successfully walked in a circle and ate. It’s basically your resume in 8-bit.",
            "I’m shocked you didn't try to peel the ghosts. Your restraint is almost professional.",
            "Congratulations on winning a game where the primary objective is 'mindless consumption.' You were born for this.",
            "You collected every banana. Somewhere, a grocery store is weeping, and I am mildly inconvenienced.",
            "I see you used the Power Pellets. It’s the only time I’ve ever seen you show aggression toward anything other than a cupcake.",
            "You survived! I already had the 'Help Wanted' sign printed, so thanks for wasting my ink.",
            "Your pathfinding skills are slightly better than a roomba with a low battery. Don't let it go to your goggles.",
            "You outran pink and blue pixels. I'll be sure to tell the Minion Council to give you a gold star and a pat on the head.",
            "Great job winning the maze. Now if only you could find the exit to the supply closet without calling for a rescue team.",
            "You’ve reached a high score! Too bad the exchange rate for 'Pac-Points' to actual currency is zero."
        ],
        "lost": [
            "You got killed by a ghost named 'Blinky.' I hope you’re proud of being bullied by a pixelated bedsheet.",
            "Congratulations! You are the only creature in history to starve to death in a room full of bananas.",
            "I watched your 'strategy.' Apparently, your plan was to aggressively run directly into the enemy's mouth. Bold move.",
            "The ghosts didn't even have to hunt you; you basically delivered yourself like a yellow, denim-clad Uber Eats order.",
            "You spent five minutes staring at a wall while a ghost approached you at 1 mph. Your situational awareness is truly legendary.",
            "I’ve seen moldy bread with better reflexes. At least the mold spreads; you just collapsed.",
            "You died with a banana in your hand. Poetic, really. Also, a total waste of fruit.",
            "If 'losing immediately' was an Olympic sport, you’d have the gold medal and a lucrative sponsorship deal.",
            "I'd offer you a 'Game Over' screen, but that implies you actually started playing. That was more of a 'Brief Embarrassment.'",
            "Don't worry, your sacrifice wasn't in vain. We’re using your goggles to replace a broken lightbulb in the basement."

    "comments": [
        "Drop the banana or become the banana bread.",
        "Your goggles won't protect you from me, yellow.",
        "I hope you taste like lemon, not denim.",
        "Blue looks better on me than you anyway.",
        "Stop running! You're just tenderizing the meat.",
        "One eye, two eyes, you’re still blind, Minion.",
        "I’m the only thing scarier than Gru's temper.",
        "A Power Pellet won't save your resume now.",
        "Ready to be a ghost in denim overalls?",
        "Running is exercise. You clearly hate exercise, Kevin."
